                <p> My name is László Fazekas, a computer system engineer, applied mathematician, and compulsive writer.</p>
                <p> I typically pen articles on topics such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and brain-computer interfaces,
                    but I also have a few hard sci-fi short stories to my name.</p>
                <p> I believe that humanity is a vast,
                    densely interconnected network where everyone influences everyone else.
                    The notion that history is written by a few impactful individuals is merely an illusion.</p>
                <p> Even the smallest action we take can have profound effects on the lives of others.
                    A well-written article, a thought-provoking book, or simply a small act of kindness can have a
                    tremendous impact on the world.</p>
                <p> Just do it! Do something cool today. This is my philosophy of life...</p>
