It’s a deceptively simple setup that continues to puzzle scientists — and illuminate the fundamental weirdness of the quantum realm.</p><h3 name="3cf8" id="3cf8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Peering Into the Quantum World: How a Simple Experiment Defies Classical Logic</h3><p name="3c12" id="3c12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In early science classes, we’re taught that atoms are the basic units of matter, each one composed of a nucleus orbited by electrons. These electrons are considered tiny particles, like miniature balls of matter.</p><p name="2c84" id="2c84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, imagine a device that can release individual electrons one at a time. Nearby, there’s a detection screen that records where each electron lands by displaying a small dot. Between the source and the screen, place a barrier with a narrow opening, such as a single slit. When an electron passes through the slit, it hits the screen and leaves a mark. After many electrons are released, you get a concentrated band of dots aligned with the slit. So far, everything matches our expectations.</p><p name="2464" id="2464" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But things take a turn when a second slit is added.</p><p name="9384" id="9384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Intuitively, we’d predict a second band of electrons to appear — one behind each slit. But that’s not what happens. Instead, the electrons create a series of alternating bands on the screen, a pattern that looks eerily like wave interference, not what you’d expect from individual particles.</p><figure name="3b41" id="3b41" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Y4W1Hz5G0fdKX1Ut.png" data-width="1920" data-height="960" src="/assets/0*Y4W1Hz5G0fdKX1Ut.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment</a></figcaption></figure><p name="efe7" id="efe7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This wave-like behavior isn’t limited to electrons. Later versions of the experiment using atoms — and even entire molecules — revealed the same surprising result. It turns out that everything we consider matter displays wave-like properties under the right conditions. We just don’t see it in daily life because these quantum effects are drowned out at larger scales.</p><h4 name="0bcb" id="0bcb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Electron’s Dilemma: A Journey Through the Slits</h4><p name="31b3" id="31b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To appreciate how mind-bending this really is, let’s imagine shrinking ourselves down to the scale of an electron. Picture yourself being fired from a mysterious quantum launcher toward a screen, with a wall in between that has two narrow slits.</p><p name="1590" id="1590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When only one slit is open, your journey is straightforward: pass through the slit and leave a mark on the screen behind it. Simple. Predictable.</p><p name="eb88" id="eb88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, let’s change the conditions slightly — open the second slit. Strangely, you still pass through just one of them, but somehow, your path changes. You no longer head straight through. Instead, you end up in a new spot on the screen, as if you’ve somehow sensed the presence of the second opening and adjusted your trajectory.</p><p name="d3ae" id="d3ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But how? How does an electron “know” that the other slit is open? What mechanism causes it to alter its path when it has no eyes, no brain, and no means of communication?</p><p name="2481" id="2481" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One tempting explanation is that the electron isn’t acting like a particle at all — it’s behaving like a wave. Interference patterns are exactly what waves produce when they pass through two openings. But that explanation opens a new can of worms.</p><p name="0642" id="0642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For one thing, we’ve never directly seen an “electron wave.” Every time we observe an electron, we detect a tiny speck at a definite location — never a diffuse wave spread across space. So, where is this wave, really? Does it exist physically, or is it just a mathematical abstraction?</p><p name="3634" id="3634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Physicists tend to lean toward the latter. They describe the behavior of electrons using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wave function</a>, which encodes the probabilities of where the electron might be found. According to this view, the electron’s path isn’t determined — only the likelihood of where it could end up.</p><p name="0f1c" id="0f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the kicker: when we actually make a measurement, the electron always shows up at a single point. Not as a blur. Not in two places at once. Just one spot. This is what’s referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the “collapse” of the wave function</a>. All the possibilities suddenly vanish, leaving just one outcome.</p><p name="3f1b" id="3f1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And here we arrive at one of the most perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics: what exactly causes the wave function to collapse? What does “collapse” even mean? Despite nearly a century of debate, there’s still no universally accepted answer.</p><blockquote name="245c" id="245c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">The wave function lets physicists calculate the odds of where an electron might appear — but when it comes to pinpointing the exact location of a single electron, no one can say for sure until it’s actually observed.</strong></blockquote><h4 name="014c" id="014c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">When Particles Slip Through Walls: Welcome to the Quantum World</h4><p name="e9ad" id="e9ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This strange mix of probabilities and wave-like behavior isn’t just a quirky detail — it’s a fundamental feature of how particles behave at the smallest scales. Take an electron, for example. Put it in a tiny, sealed container, and you might think it’s trapped there. But in the quantum world, things aren’t so simple.</p><p name="3e39" id="3e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leave the electron alone for a while, and the next time you check, there’s a real chance it won’t be in the box anymore. It’s not that it broke through the wall — it more or less slipped through it. This effect is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a>.</p><p name="2c3b" id="2c3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quantum tunneling isn’t just a theoretical curiosity. It’s one of the reasons modern electronics face real limits. As engineers pack transistors more closely and wires thinner in microprocessors, they eventually reach a point where electrons start to “leak” through barriers. At that scale, electrons don’t stay put — they tunnel, sometimes jumping into nearby circuits.</p><p name="294b" id="294b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, despite its weirdness, quantum mechanics has become one of our most powerful tools. It has already revolutionized technologies — from semiconductors to lasers — and it’s laying the groundwork for the next leap forward: quantum computing. These future machines won’t rely on certainty, but on probability itself, potentially unlocking massive computing power far beyond what traditional systems can achieve.</p><h3 name="5966" id="5966" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Mystery of Collapse: When Probability Becomes Reality</h3><p name="6043" id="6043" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">With the help of the wave function, physicists can predict the odds of where a particle <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">might</em> appear with incredible precision. But for all this mathematical power, we still don’t know what determines <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em> the particle shows up. What triggers the collapse of the wave function? And more fundamentally, what <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> the wave function?</p><p name="897d" id="897d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These questions have haunted quantum theory since its earliest days. Over the decades, physicists and philosophers alike have proposed various explanations, known collectively as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>.</p><h4 name="d126" id="d126" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Pilot-Wave Theory and the Bizarre Reality of Quantum Entanglement</h4><p name="46e6" id="46e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Among the many attempts to make sense of quantum behavior, one interpretation stands out for offering a somewhat more intuitive picture: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_wave_theory" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_wave_theory" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the pilot-wave theory</a>. First proposed by Louis de Broglie and later developed by David Bohm, it suggests that particles — like electrons—are still particles, but they’re accompanied by a kind of invisible wave that guides their motion.</p><p name="e737" id="e737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This guiding wave doesn’t just point the way. It can interfere with itself, shaping the paths particles take and giving rise to patterns like the interference fringes seen in the double-slit experiment. In this view, electrons aren’t behaving like waves — they’re riding waves.</p><p name="469b" id="469b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s where things get weird.</p><p name="e793" id="e793" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pilot-wave isn’t a local phenomenon. It doesn’t stay neatly confined to the vicinity of the particle it guides. Instead, it spans space instantly, meaning what happens to one particle can immediately affect another, no matter how far away it is. It’s as if space, as we understand it, doesn’t apply. To fully describe one particle’s state, in principle, you’d need to consider the entire universe. That’s how interconnected everything becomes in this model.</p><p name="885a" id="885a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">non-locality</a> — where distant events seem to influence each other faster than light — lies at the heart of quantum theory. For years, it was an unsettling theoretical idea. Then, in a series of ingenious experiments, physicists tested it in the real world. Their groundbreaking work earned the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p><p name="8b5e" id="8b5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key to these experiments was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">entanglement</a>, a phenomenon where two particles are generated in such a way that they remain linked, no matter how far apart they travel. For example, two electrons might be entangled by a property known as spin. While spin is often described as if the particle were rotating, it’s better understood as a fundamental quantum property — more like charge or mass than actual spinning.</p><p name="42ba" id="42ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An electron’s spin can be “up” or “down,” but in an entangled pair, if one is measured as up, the other must be down. Until a measurement is made, however, neither particle has a definite spin. Instead, they exist in a kind of blended, uncertain state described by their shared wave function.</p><p name="00c5" id="00c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s where the experiment gets interesting. Suppose spin were determined in advance, just hidden from us. In that case, repeated measurements would follow a predictable pattern, like flipping a fair coin. But the results don’t match what we’d expect from such hidden variables. Instead, they follow a different distribution — one that only makes sense if spin isn’t determined until the moment of measurement.</p><p name="5efb" id="5efb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To illustrate this, imagine rolling a die hundreds of times. If it’s fair, each number should appear roughly the same number of times. But if you notice six showing up way more often, you’d suspect the die is rigged. In quantum mechanics, it’s as if the outcome of the roll depends not just on the die, but on how you choose to look at it — and the die “loads” itself accordingly, right before your eyes.</p><p name="c877" id="c877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now take that bizarre idea and apply it to two particles separated by huge distances. Measure the spin of one, and the other instantly reflects the complementary value — even if it’s light-years away. The choice of what you measure here affects what happens there, with no time delay.</p><p name="0144" id="0144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the phenomenon Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance.” He hoped that future experiments would reveal hidden variables that would rescue locality and determinism. But when those experiments were finally performed, they proved just the opposite: non-locality is real, and it’s an unavoidable part of quantum theory.</p><p name="9a5a" id="9a5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we’re left with a strange conclusion: the act of measuring spin doesn’t just reveal a value — it creates it. And in doing so, it changes the state of another particle, instantly, no matter how far apart they are.</p><h4 name="3149" id="3149" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Parallel Worlds and Infinite Paths: Quantum Reality Gets Even Stranger</h4><p name="55f9" id="55f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Physicists have tried to avoid the unsettling idea of non-locality, but the alternatives aren’t any less bizarre. One of the most striking is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Many-Worlds Interpretation</a>, first proposed by Hugh Everett. In this view, the wave function isn’t just a mathematical tool — it’s real, and it never collapses. Instead, every time a measurement is made, reality splits. One universe branches into many, with each possible outcome playing out in its own parallel world.</p><p name="7e04" id="7e04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, when you measure an electron’s spin, the universe doesn’t choose just one result. It chooses <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all</em> of them, each in a separate, newly created universe.</p><p name="9cd3" id="9cd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If that sounds wild to you, you’re not alone.</p><p name="620f" id="620f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, this isn’t as far removed from mainstream physics as it might seem. Richard Feynman — one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century — developed his famous path integral formulation of quantum electrodynamics based on a similarly mind-bending idea: that a particle like an electron doesn’t take just one path from point A to point B. It explores <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">every</em> possible path.</p><p name="78dd" id="78dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To predict where the electron ends up, you don’t just trace a straight line. You consider every imaginable route it could take, assign each a probability, and add them all together. The interference pattern on the screen? That’s the result of this sum over infinite possibilities.</p><p name="5d2c" id="5d2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The catch? There are literally <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">infinitely</em> many paths. Most mathematicians would run screaming at the thought of calculating such a thing. But Feynman wasn’t like most people. He found a clever way to cancel out the infinities and distill something useful — and shockingly accurate — from the math.</p><p name="abc5" id="abc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His approach led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum electrodynamics (QED)</a>, a theory that explains how light and matter interact with extraordinary precision. It revolutionized our understanding of atoms, chemical reactions, and the fundamental workings of the universe. For this, Feynman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.</p><p name="2cec" id="2cec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But despite his success, Feynman remained humble about the implications of his work. In later lectures, he famously admitted that even he didn’t fully understand what quantum mechanics was really saying. The math worked, the predictions matched experiments — but the underlying reality? That was still a mystery.</p><p name="7b7e" id="7b7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As he put it: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”</em> And if someone claims they do, Feynman warned, they’re probably fooling themselves.</p><h4 name="8f1b" id="8f1b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Back to the Future? When Quantum Physics Plays with Time</h4><p name="f45d" id="f45d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If juggling parallel universes or infinite paths feels too much, there’s another route physicists have explored — one that’s no less mind-bending: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">retrocausality</a>.</p><p name="741d" id="741d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Retrocausality suggests that effects can happen before their causes. In plain language, we’re talking about a form of time travel, though not the sci-fi kind with flux capacitors and DeLoreans. Instead of people moving through time, it’s information that travels backward.</p><p name="4a90" id="4a90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This interpretation tries to sidestep the uncomfortable non-locality of quantum entanglement and the mathematical headaches of infinite possibilities. Here’s how it works: when we measure an electron’s spin, that measurement doesn’t just affect the future. It sends a kind of signal backward through time, reaching all the way back to when the entangled particles were first created.</p><p name="6548" id="6548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The result? The electron’s spin appears to have been “set” in just the right way from the very beginning, so that when we finally get around to measuring it, everything lines up exactly as quantum theory predicts.</p><p name="e388" id="e388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Put another way: the electron seems to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">already know</em> how you’re going to measure it. And it prepares for that outcome <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">before</em> you’ve even made a choice.</p><p name="ce75" id="ce75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a deeply unsettling idea — but one that avoids some of the paradoxes posed by other interpretations. Whether nature actually works this way remains up for debate, but it shows just how far we’re willing to stretch our understanding of time, causality, and reality to make sense of the quantum world.</p><h4 name="23c3" id="23c3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">No Free Will? The Deterministic Escape Hatch of Superdeterminism</h4><p name="8cf7" id="8cf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Still not sold on retrocausality and quantum time-travel? There’s one more interpretation physicists have considered — one that sounds surprisingly simple at first, but comes with an unsettling cost: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">superdeterminism</a>.</p><p name="1228" id="1228" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the heart of the experiments that confirmed quantum non-locality is a crucial assumption — that the measurement settings (the way scientists configure their detectors) are chosen freely and randomly, like rolling a die. Superdeterminism throws that assumption out the window. It says there is no randomness.</p><p name="0c12" id="0c12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to this view, the universe is entirely deterministic. Everything that happens — from the spin of an electron to the way a physicist tweaks a dial on a detector — was already determined from the very beginning. Everything was written into the fabric of reality at the moment of the Big Bang.</p><p name="2e73" id="2e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under superdeterminism, there’s no need for spooky faster-than-light signals or bizarre temporal loops. No infinite paths, no collapsing wave functions. The strange statistical outcomes of quantum experiments? All pre-programmed. The universe simply unfolds, following a script written at the dawn of time.</p><p name="9077" id="9077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mathematically, it works. You don’t need probabilities or paradoxes. The equations align beautifully. But the cost? Immense.</p><p name="d396" id="d396" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this to be true, the entire cosmos would have to be fine-tuned with unimaginable precision. Not just particles and stars, but your neurons, your thoughts, your decisions — everything would have to follow the script. Even the act of setting up a “random” measurement is only random in appearance. Behind the curtain, it was inevitable all along.</p><p name="085d" id="085d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine rolling a die and getting a six nearly every time. Under superdeterminism, that’s not suspicious — it’s just the way things are. The die, your hand, your brain, the laws of physics — all coordinated from the very start to produce that outcome.</p><p name="9bd5" id="9bd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, it’s logically possible, but really bizarre, and hard to accept.</p><p name="44dd" id="44dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And here’s the kicker: if superdeterminism is right, then free will is an illusion. Every choice you think you’re making was prewritten. Every decision, every moment of doubt, every burst of inspiration — they were all part of the plan.</p><p name="4cfd" id="4cfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not just quantum mechanics we’re questioning anymore. It’s our sense of agency, of autonomy, of what it means to be human.</p><h4 name="bf2d" id="bf2d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Consciousness at the Center? The Copenhagen Interpretation and the Role of the Observer</h4><p name="98d7" id="98d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If we’re not ready to give up on free will — or accept a universe completely scripted from the start — we eventually circle back to the most famous interpretation of them all: the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Copenhagen interpretation</a>.</p><p name="6416" id="6416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to this view, the wave function does collapse — but only when a measurement is made. The act of observation isn’t just passive; it plays a critical role in deciding the outcome.</p><p name="22ab" id="22ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the problem: what exactly counts as a “measurement”? After all, measuring devices are made of atoms and electrons too. They follow the same quantum rules as everything else. So, how can they collapse a wave function if they’re also part of the quantum system?</p><p name="d235" id="d235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s where things take a philosophical turn.</p><p name="b8f2" id="b8f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some versions of the Copenhagen interpretation suggest that what really causes the collapse isn’t the measuring device — it’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_causes_collapse" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_causes_collapse" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conscious observer</a>. In other words, reality becomes definite only when it enters the mind of someone observing it.</p><p name="7783" id="7783" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This idea was seriously considered by Nobel Prize–winning physicist Eugene Wigner. He proposed that consciousness might be a fundamental component of the universe — something that can’t be reduced to physical interactions alone. Wigner even speculated that we might need to return to a kind of dualism, where mind and matter are distinct, coexisting layers of reality.</p><p name="3f5b" id="3f5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wigner openly identified consciousness as the trigger for wave function collapse, while most other physicists took a more cautious, materialist stance. And yet, almost every scientist who has wrestled with quantum mechanics has, at some point, questioned the nature of reality itself.</p><p name="61af" id="61af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a>, for instance, went beyond the technical realm and explored Eastern philosophical traditions in his writings. He was particularly drawn to the idea — found in philosophies like Advaita Vedanta — that all conscious beings are, at their core, expressions of a single, unified consciousness. In this view, individuality is an illusion, and there is ultimately only <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">one</em> conscious entity, experiencing itself in countless forms.</p><p name="84ab" id="84ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a powerful argument in favor of the consciousness-based view: that the only thing we can be absolutely sure of is our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">own</em> existence — and, with it, the existence of our consciousness. We don’t experience the world directly; everything we know comes filtered through our senses. So, in principle, reality itself may be an illusion — that we’re just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brains in vats</a>, fed sensations by some external source.</p><p name="491e" id="491e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can’t even be sure that anyone else exists, or that others possess consciousness. After all, we have no way of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">experiencing</em> another mind. The only thing we can know for certain is the reality of our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">own</em> consciousness — our awareness, our inner experience.</p><p name="8746" id="8746" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if that’s the only undeniable fact of existence, perhaps it deserves a more central role in our understanding of the universe.</p><p name="5a89" id="5a89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But invoking consciousness in physics opens a philosophical Pandora’s box. We’re no longer just dealing with particles and wave functions — we’re now facing ancient and unresolved questions:</p><p name="a2b3" id="a2b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What exactly is consciousness?<br >At what point does a creature become aware?<br >Is a dog conscious? A fly? A self-driving car?</p><p name="5c72" id="5c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if consciousness plays a role in shaping reality, how do we define it scientifically?</p><p name="deb6" id="deb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These questions remain open. But as strange as it may sound, modern physics may not be able to avoid them forever.</p><h4 name="9234" id="9234" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Closing the Loop: Quantum Weirdness Is Here to Stay</h4><p name="bf23" id="bf23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If none of the interpretations we’ve explored feel satisfying, you’re not alone. And rest assured — there are plenty more. A quick glance at Wikipedia reveals a whole gallery of alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum interpretations</a>, each one stranger than the last.</p><p name="db98" id="db98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the nature of the beast. Quantum mechanics isn’t just counterintuitive — it’s radically disconnected from anything we experience in daily life. Our brains evolved to make sense of apples falling from trees and rocks skipping across ponds, not particles that exist in multiple states or influence each other across light-years.</p><p name="cdc7" id="cdc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Einstein introduced relativity, it challenged our sense of time and space — but it gave us a beautiful picture in return: a four-dimensional spacetime, like a fabric that bends under the weight of matter. It was weird, sure, but we could still picture it.</p><p name="3b91" id="3b91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quantum mechanics doesn’t offer that luxury.</p><p name="87e3" id="87e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It unravels the very notions of space, time, and causality. In this world, particles far apart can affect each other instantly. Some influences might even move backward through time. And when we try to ask why or how, all we get in return is… math.</p><p name="a3ef" id="a3ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But somehow, the math works. Despite the philosophical chaos underneath, quantum mechanics produces predictions with astonishing accuracy. It powers the technologies we rely on every day — from smartphones to MRI machines — and it continues to push the boundaries of what’s technologically possible.</p><p name="7854" id="7854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So maybe this is the best model we’ll ever have: not a neat storybook picture of reality, but a vast, intricate system of probabilities — an engine of computation beyond our grasp. In that sense, the universe behaves like a colossal computer, and our consciousness is the user interface: shaped by sensory input, but ultimately separate from the machine’s inner workings.</p><p name="e56c" id="e56c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps we’ll never truly “understand” reality in the classical sense. But maybe that’s not a flaw — it’s a reflection of our own limits as observers inside the system. Even if our internal models are incomplete or imperfect, they still allow us to get surprisingly close to the truth.</p><p name="c223" id="c223" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And sometimes, that’s more than enough.</p></div></div></section><section name="718f" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d040" id="d040" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">My other writings on scientific topics:</p><div name="ce08" id="ce08" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://thebojda.medium.com/how-einsteins-special-relativity-theory-redefined-space-and-time-45b79573443d" data-href="https://thebojda.medium.com/how-einsteins-special-relativity-theory-redefined-space-and-time-45b79573443d" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://thebojda.medium.com/how-einsteins-special-relativity-theory-redefined-space-and-time-45b79573443d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">How Einstein’s Special Relativity Theory Redefined Space and Time</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">When Albert Einstein unveiled his theory of Special Relativity, he did more than propose a new scientific framework —…</em>thebojda.medium.com</a><a href="https://thebojda.medium.com/how-einsteins-special-relativity-theory-redefined-space-and-time-45b79573443d" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="a65037924829a1bccb331364057ca99d" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*Keh28NgTuhBpE3zk" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*Keh28NgTuhBpE3zk);"></a></div><div name="b382" id="b382" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Intergalactic Aliens: A Reality Check on Starships, Nanobots, and Cosmic Evolution</strong><br >medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="80796386826f956cadcada4f904382ba" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*BUIiPSgxxCoCuG0g9NggHA.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*BUIiPSgxxCoCuG0g9NggHA.png);"></a></div><div name="6180" id="6180" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">How to Escape From the Simulation</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">In 2023, a research paper surfaced that tackled a fascinating and somewhat unsettling question: if our reality is…</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="457e049f1cd0b11ae118a8bf75488fa2" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*FjAaMQ8kN7ZXBJcOm_7Jww.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*FjAaMQ8kN7ZXBJcOm_7Jww.png);"></a></div><div name="a1e5" id="a1e5" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Free Energy Principle and the Ultimate Simulation: Are Our Brains Already Wired Together?</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">One day, my son asked me why people are afraid of the dark.
