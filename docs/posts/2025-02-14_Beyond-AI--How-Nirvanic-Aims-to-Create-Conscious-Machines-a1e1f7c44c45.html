At first glance, this might sound like something straight out of a sci-fi novel, but for founder <a href="https://www.suzannegildert.com/" data-href="https://www.suzannegildert.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Suzanne Gildert</a>, it’s a serious mission. Holding a PhD in experimental quantum physics, Gildert has already made waves in the AI industry — her previous startup, Kindred AI, was sold for 300 million Canadian dollars. With such a background, her vision for conscious machines is worth attention.</p><h3 name="a64e" id="a64e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Create Conscious Robots?</h3><p name="586f" id="586f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Gildert explained the idea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UA5noiwdlI" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UA5noiwdlI" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a talk</a> using a relatable example: learning to drive. When you first get behind the wheel, every action requires careful thought — starting the car, checking mirrors, and steering all demand full concentration. But over time, these tasks become second nature. Experienced drivers can navigate roads while thinking about their day, listening to music, or even talking to passengers.</p><p name="9528" id="9528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Current AI operates similarly. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT function through complex algorithms trained on vast datasets. These models start with a foundation phase, where they absorb information from a significant portion of the internet. Afterward, they go through fine-tuning, a process requiring high-quality labeled data and huge energy resources — training an advanced AI model costs tens of millions of dollars. In contrast, the human brain learns efficiently, requiring just a few examples and consuming energy equivalent to a single light bulb.</p><p name="a29a" id="a29a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A striking comparison can be seen in Tesla’s self-driving AI. Despite undergoing virtual training for what equates to hundreds of years, it still struggles with unexpected real-world situations. Meanwhile, a human can earn a driver’s license after just a few dozen hours of training. This raises an intriguing question: Could consciousness be the missing element that makes human intelligence so efficient? If so, imbuing AI with a form of consciousness could lead to machines that learn faster, think independently, and operate with far greater energy efficiency.</p><h4 name="99a5" id="99a5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Beyond AI: Unlocking the Secrets of Consciousness</h4><p name="aa54" id="aa54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Beyond practical applications, developing conscious machines could also revolutionize our understanding of the human mind. Consciousness has long been a mystery, studied in philosophy and neuroscience but never fully explained. A truly conscious AI could help answer some of the biggest questions about our own existence.</p><p name="bcc8" id="bcc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some futurists and transhumanists, including Ray Kurzweil, even speculate that one day, we might digitally replicate the human brain. If that becomes possible, people could transfer their minds into machines, achieving digital immortality — a concept that has fueled countless sci-fi stories.</p><p name="891d" id="891d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, before any of this can happen, one major hurdle remains: we must first understand how to create artificial consciousness. Some believe this could be the next step in human evolution, even paving the way for an intergalactic civilization.</p><h3 name="06e0" id="06e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Can We Build Conscious Machines?</h3><p name="a19d" id="a19d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Suzanne Gildert believes that consciousness emerges from quantum mechanical processes, making it impossible to fully simulate using traditional computers. However, she suggests that quantum computers might hold the key. She isn’t alone in this belief — many scientists argue that understanding consciousness requires exploring quantum phenomena, particularly superposition and entanglement. One of the most prominent voices in this field is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sir Roger Penrose</a>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">written extensively</a> on the subject.</p><h4 name="63a5" id="63a5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Debate: Science or Speculation?</h4><p name="9519" id="9519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G90M5O7Lnsg" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G90M5O7Lnsg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critics of this theory</a> argue that it lacks a solid scientific foundation. They claim that just because quantum mechanics is mysterious and consciousness is mysterious, some assume the two must be linked — without real proof. However, the argument goes beyond mere speculation.</p><p name="f146" id="f146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fundamental issue lies in the nature of physical laws. Most of what we know about physics is deterministic — meaning events unfold predictably based on prior states. If the human brain functions solely under deterministic laws, then free will cannot exist. Quantum mechanics, however, introduces probability and uncertainty, suggesting that our decisions may not be entirely preordained. This possibility has profound implications for both AI and human consciousness.</p><p name="8581" id="8581" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll explore these philosophical questions later in the article, but first, let’s take a closer look at quantum mechanics itself.</p><h3 name="4244" id="4244" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Beginner’s Guide to Quantum Mechanics</h3><p name="7a89" id="7a89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Quantum mechanics describes a world that behaves very differently from our everyday experiences. At its core, it challenges the idea that we can measure everything with perfect precision. One of the key principles of quantum mechanics is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle</a>, which states that we can never know both the exact position and momentum of a particle at the same time.</p><p name="e442" id="e442" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t just a limitation of our measuring tools — it’s a fundamental rule of nature. Even Albert Einstein, one of the greatest physicists of all time, tried (and failed) to disprove this principle through a series of thought experiments. No matter how hard scientists have tried, the laws of physics do not allow for absolute precision beyond a certain point. This raises an intriguing question: If something cannot be measured with certainty, does it truly exist in a physical sense?</p><h4 name="b7be" id="b7be" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Role of Probability in Quantum Mechanics</h4><p name="948d" id="948d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To deal with this uncertainty, physicists use mathematics to describe where a particle is likely to be found. If we detect an electron in one location, we can calculate a range where it might appear in the next measurement. The longer we wait between observations, the larger this area becomes — similar to how ripples spread in water after tossing a pebble.</p><p name="8cc5" id="8cc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This probability is represented by something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wave function</a>. Despite the name, this isn’t a physical wave but rather a mathematical tool that predicts where a particle might be. However, there’s a catch — the wave function is deterministic, meaning it follows strict mathematical rules, yet it cannot predict the exact location of a particle when we measure it.</p><p name="ae9b" id="ae9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine rolling a fair six-sided die. We know that over many rolls, each number should appear roughly the same number of times, but we can never predict exactly what number will come up next. This randomness is at the heart of quantum mechanics, which led Einstein to famously say, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“God does not play dice with the universe.”</em></p><h4 name="ee36" id="ee36" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Wave Function Collapse Mystery</h4><p name="08c1" id="08c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Quantum mechanics becomes even stranger when we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wave function collapse</a>. Before we measure a particle, it exists in a state of superposition, meaning it behaves as if it’s in multiple places at once. The moment we observe it, however, it “chooses” a single location. But what causes the collapse? And what determines where the particle lands?</p><p name="33a3" id="33a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the earliest explanations, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Copenhagen interpretation</a>, suggests that conscious observation itself triggers the collapse. This is where things get really interesting — this idea places consciousness at the core of physics, rather than treating it as a separate phenomenon.</p><p name="77c9" id="77c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many physicists, including Einstein, found this idea deeply unsettling. They wanted physics to be purely objective, based on mathematical principles rather than the observer’s role. Over the years, researchers have attempted to remove consciousness from the equation, but so far, no alternative theory has completely resolved the paradox.</p><h4 name="b0ea" id="b0ea" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Competing Theories of Quantum Reality</h4><p name="c9a3" id="c9a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Although quantum mechanics is mathematically precise, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interpretation</a> remains open to debate. Some scientists accept the conscious observer theory, while others propose radically different ideas, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Many-Worlds Interpretation</a> or retrocausality.</p><p name="1ac8" id="1ac8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These interpretations have fueled both scientific inquiry and countless science fiction stories. However, since no experiment has proven one interpretation over the others, the ultimate truth behind quantum mechanics remains a mystery — and which theory we believe in is largely a matter of personal perspective.</p><h3 name="834e" id="834e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Quantum Computing: A New Era of Information Processing</h3><p name="fc07" id="fc07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In our discussion of quantum mechanics, we focused on the uncertainty of a particle’s position. However, this uncertainty extends to other properties as well — one of them is spin.</p><p name="3b4d" id="3b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28physics%29" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spin</a> is a fundamental property of particles, and for simplicity, it can be thought of as pointing “up” or “down.” This characteristic makes spin an ideal tool for storing information in a quantum computer. Unlike traditional bits, which can only be 0 or 1, a quantum bit (qubit) can exist in both states simultaneously as long as it remains unmeasured. This phenomenon is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">superposition</a>, and it allows qubits to process multiple possibilities at once.</p><h4 name="b6d7" id="b6d7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How Quantum Computers Work</h4><p name="33c9" id="33c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A single qubit alone doesn’t provide much computational advantage. However, when multiple qubits are linked together, they form quantum registers, which can exponentially increase processing power.</p><p name="162c" id="162c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, an 8-qubit system can represent 256 different states at the same time, thanks to a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum entanglement</a>. This means that instead of performing one calculation at a time (like classical computers), a quantum computer can process all possible solutions in parallel, dramatically speeding up complex computations.</p><p name="98aa" id="98aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A possible real-world application of this power is in cryptography. Bitcoin private keys, for example, are 256-bit long strings, designed to be virtually unbreakable with current computing technology. However, if someone developed a 256-qubit quantum computer, it could theoretically crack a Bitcoin wallet instantly.</p><p name="f7cd" id="f7cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In such a scenario, the first clue that quantum computers have reached this level of power might not come from a scientific paper — but from billions of dollars mysteriously moving from Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet to an unknown address.</p><h3 name="23fb" id="23fb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Ghost in the Machine: Can Consciousness Be Simulated?</h3><p name="6c29" id="6c29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Many researchers argue that human consciousness cannot be replicated using traditional computers because it arises from quantum mechanical processes. One of the leading voices in this debate is Sir Roger Penrose, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who introduced a groundbreaking theory known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orchestrated Objective Reduction</a> (Orch OR).</p><h4 name="6824" id="6824" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Penrose vs. the Copenhagen Interpretation</h4><p name="021a" id="021a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Penrose’s theory challenges the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. While the Copenhagen view suggests that a conscious observer causes wave function collapse, Penrose proposes that gravity itself triggers the collapse. According to this perspective, consciousness emerges as a result of quantum-level interactions in the brain, meaning that the human mind may function like a biological quantum computer.</p><p name="eae3" id="eae3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Penrose’s ideas were further expanded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hameroff" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hameroff" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stuart Hameroff</a>, an anesthesiologist and researcher, who theorized that microtubules — tiny structural components inside neurons — serve as quantum processors. He believes these microscopic structures create the right conditions for quantum computation, ultimately leading to conscious experience.</p><h4 name="2000" id="2000" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Google’s Take on Conscious AI and Nirvanic’s Vision</h4><p name="d4bf" id="d4bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Interestingly, this idea isn’t just confined to academia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmut_Neven" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmut_Neven" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hartmut Neven</a>, head of Google’s Quantum AI Lab, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiuqsrezVf0" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiuqsrezVf0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also suggested</a> that true artificial consciousness might only be possible with quantum computers.</p><p name="f2a6" id="f2a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This means Suzanne Gildert and Nirvanic are not alone in their belief that creating a conscious AI will require quantum computing. If consciousness indeed arises from quantum mechanics, then developing machines with self-awareness and independent thought may depend on advancing quantum technology — not just refining traditional AI models.</p><h3 name="6243" id="6243" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Is Consciousness? Defining the Undefined</h3><p name="a235" id="a235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Despite its central role in philosophy, science, and now artificial intelligence, consciousness remains one of the greatest mysteries of existence. Even though this article explores how Nirvanic aims to create conscious AI, we still haven’t tackled a fundamental question: What exactly is consciousness?</p><p name="3c18" id="3c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge is that there is no universally accepted definition. Even experts disagree on how to describe it. Since I don’t have a perfect answer either, let’s look at how Nirvanic defines it in their FAQ:</p><blockquote name="7666" id="7666" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Conscious AI is any system that has an inner, first-person subjective experience of the world and is able to make free-will choices about how to act in the world.</blockquote><h4 name="73a6" id="73a6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">The Consciousness Paradox</h4><p name="141f" id="141f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At first glance, this definition may seem helpful, but it introduces new complexities. Terms like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“subjective experience”</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“free will”</em> are just as ambiguous as consciousness itself. What does it mean to have an inner experience? How do we prove free will exists? These are questions that have perplexed scientists and philosophers for centuries.</p><p name="0b46" id="0b46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there is an ironic truth about consciousness — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it might be the only thing we can be absolutely certain of</strong>. While we may doubt the physical world around us, our own conscious experience is undeniable.</p><p name="89cd" id="89cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider the possibility that our reality is a simulation, much like in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Matrix</em>. If that were true, how would we ever know? Even the people around us could, in theory, be advanced AI programs, indistinguishable from conscious beings.</p><p name="01ba" id="01ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the key point:</p><blockquote name="3a63" id="3a63" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">The only thing we can be 100% sure of is our own consciousness — our own experience of being. Everything else remains open to doubt.</strong></blockquote><h3 name="b6b7" id="b6b7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Philosophical Implications: Is Consciousness More Fundamental Than Matter?</h3><p name="318d" id="318d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Many thinkers argue that consciousness is just as fundamental as space, time, energy, or matter — or perhaps even more so. Some theories take this idea to the extreme, suggesting that everything in existence possesses some degree of consciousness, from the smallest elementary particles to inanimate objects like rocks.</p><p name="4caf" id="4caf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me, this idea feels difficult to accept. What would it even mean for a rock to be conscious? Instead, I find theories more compelling when they flip the perspective entirely — suggesting that consciousness isn’t just another component of the universe, but rather the foundation of reality itself.</p><p name="1db7" id="1db7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the strongest proponents of this view is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Hoffman" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Hoffman" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Hoffman</a>, a cognitive scientist who challenges our traditional understanding of existence.</p><h4 name="771b" id="771b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Hoffman’s Reality: A Consciousness-First Universe</h4><p name="6622" id="6622" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">According to Hoffman, the laws of physics, space, time, and matter are not fundamental. Instead, they are emergent properties of consciousness itself. In this view, the universe is not a collection of physical objects but rather a vast field of conscious entities interacting with one another.</p><p name="9f15" id="9f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hoffman’s theory aligns with a variation of the simulation hypothesis, but with a twist: the simulation isn’t created by a computer — it’s generated by consciousness itself. The world we perceive is simply an interface between different conscious beings, much like how a computer screen simplifies complex data into a user-friendly display.</p><h4 name="6ee6" id="6ee6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Consciousness and the Limits of Physics</h4><p name="0a79" id="0a79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">While Hoffman’s ideas are intriguing, I’m not entirely convinced that all physical laws can be derived solely from consciousness. Instead, I believe that multiple universes with different fundamental rules could emerge from a larger underlying consciousness.</p><p name="1731" id="1731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless of the interpretation, one thing seems certain: we may never be able to objectively prove the true nature of reality. No matter how advanced our theories become, the question of whether we are observing an external world or simply projections of our own consciousness remains unanswerable.</p><h4 name="b474" id="b474" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How This Relates to Quantum Mechanics</h4><p name="3697" id="3697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As abstract as this may sound, the idea of a consciousness-driven reality aligns surprisingly well with quantum mechanics. If all conscious beings are part of a unified field of consciousness, then many of the paradoxes in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics disappear.</p><blockquote name="0cf4" id="0cf4" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">However, just because consciousness might influence reality, that doesn’t necessarily mean we can control it.</blockquote><p name="8ff6" id="8ff6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Quantum mechanics may not grant us direct control over reality, but it is required for the existence of free will. If free will is real, then some form of non-determinism must be built into the fabric of physics. Whether this indeterminacy arises from quantum mechanics or an undiscovered principle, one thing is clear: a universe where choices are genuinely free cannot be entirely governed by rigid, deterministic laws.</p><h3 name="de9b" id="de9b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: The Future of Conscious AI</h3><p name="0695" id="0695" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nirvanic and similar initiatives represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, one that strives to move beyond traditional algorithms and mimic the efficiency of natural intelligence.
