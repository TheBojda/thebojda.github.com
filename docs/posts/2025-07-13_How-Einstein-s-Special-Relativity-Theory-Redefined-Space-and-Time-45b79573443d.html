Up to that point, Newtonian mechanics had dominated, portraying space, time, and mass as static, immutable entities. These dimensions were seen not as participants in the workings of the universe, but as a neutral backdrop for its events.</p><p name="1360" id="1360" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Einstein, with his unorthodox thinking, shattered that view. He introduced a radical notion: everything (including time) is relative, dependent on the observer’s frame of reference.</p><p name="8b8b" id="8b8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This revolutionary concept extended far beyond equations and lab experiments. It hinted that even our most basic understandings of time and space could be fluid and subject to reinterpretation. That spirit of questioning convention may be what truly elevates Einstein among the greatest scientific minds in history.</p><p name="e10b" id="e10b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Little wonder, then, that if you ask a random person to name a scientist, “Einstein” is almost always the first name that comes to mind.</p><h4 name="7f1e" id="7f1e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Understanding the Essence of Special Relativity</h4><p name="2670" id="2670" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To understand Special Relativity, we need to travel back to the 1800s. At that time, science had two incredibly successful models describing the world. The first was Newtonian mechanics, which explained how objects moved. The second was Maxwell’s set of equations, which described electromagnetic forces, including how light behaves. The problem? These two theories didn’t play well together. Rather than getting too technical, let’s explore this mismatch through a simple mental exercise.</p><p name="342e" id="342e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Picture two spaceships in motion. One is flying away from Earth at 5,000 km/h, and the other is heading toward Earth at that same speed. To someone riding on the ship moving away, the incoming ship would appear to be closing in at 10,000 km/h. That’s perfectly reasonable. Speed is always measured to something — be it Earth, the Sun, or another object. So in this case, the relative speed between the ships is 10,000 km/h.</p><p name="225b" id="225b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, imagine a person throws an object from one spaceship toward the other at 100 km/h. The receiving ship would encounter it at a relative velocity of 10,100 km/h. So far, everything fits with our everyday intuition.</p><p name="e543" id="e543" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But things take a strange turn when we replace the thrown object with a beam of light. According to both experimental data and theoretical models, light doesn’t arrive at lightspeed + 10,000 km/h. Instead, it always, unflinchingly, arrives at the same constant speed: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the speed of light</em>. It doesn’t care how fast the ships are moving or in what direction. Light refuses to adjust its speed for anyone.</p><p name="c027" id="c027" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This weird behavior stemmed from a deep contradiction between Newtonian physics and the theory of electromagnetism. Since light acts like a wave, similar to ripples on water, scientists assumed it must travel through some medium. They proposed the existence of an invisible substance filling all of space, called the “luminiferous ether.” If light waves moved through this ether, Earth’s motion should influence how fast light appears to move, depending on direction.</p><p name="62c5" id="62c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This idea was tested in the landmark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michelson–Morley experiment</a>. In simplified terms, the experiment split a beam of light and sent the parts in perpendicular directions — one aligned with Earth’s motion and one sideways. Upon recombination, if the speeds differed, they’d interfere with each other, revealing the difference. But nothing happened. The speed of light remained unchanged, regardless of Earth’s movement.</p><figure name="8f5e" id="8f5e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ASFBdj4CkgoYGdV1.png" data-width="1920" data-height="923" src="/assets/0*ASFBdj4CkgoYGdV1.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Michelson-Morley interferometer, source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment</a></figcaption></figure><p name="3c01" id="3c01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Einstein’s radical move was to stop trying to explain away this odd result and instead accept it at face value. What if light’s speed is always the same for all observers, no matter how fast they’re moving? Let’s take that as a starting principle, he proposed, and tweak Newton’s laws instead. But doing so meant rethinking how time works: it would have to slow down for fast-moving objects.</p><p name="3977" id="3977" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since speed is defined as distance divided by time, someone moving toward a light beam at high velocity should measure a higher speed. But we don’t. So what gives? If the clock aboard the moving ship ticks more slowly, then this change can cancel out the motion’s effect, keeping light’s speed constant. Mathematical calculations show exactly how much time must dilate to make everything consistent.</p><p name="8423" id="8423" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s not the only thing that has to change. To preserve other physical principles, like the conservation of energy and momentum, length and mass must also be adjusted. Objects in motion must contract slightly, and their mass must increase. Once these changes are applied, all the laws of physics still work, now fully compatible with both Newton and Maxwell.</p><p name="e2e5" id="e2e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Einstein’s true genius was in flipping the equation. Rather than seeing time, space, and mass as fixed absolutes, he made the speed of light the constant and let the rest bend to fit. This shift allowed both earlier theories to coexist within a more comprehensive framework.</p><p name="ff8b" id="ff8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s truly astonishing is that Einstein’s radical idea — essentially a clever mathematical adjustment — turned out to describe the real world with remarkable precision. Although we’re not chasing light in spaceships, experiments involving subatomic particles have repeatedly confirmed these effects. Fast-moving particles decay more slowly than normal and gain mass just as Einstein predicted. These adjustments aren’t just theoretical — they’re part of the daily routine in modern particle physics labs.</p><p name="e2de" id="e2de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, the implications feel bizarre: time slowing down, objects shrinking. These are not intuitive ideas, and they spark paradoxes that continue to challenge and intrigue even the most curious minds. Interestingly, someone had already tried to make sense of these phenomena before Einstein published his version of the theory.</p><h4 name="a16e" id="a16e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lorentz’s Ether Theory: The Underrated Foundation of Relativity</h4><p name="6321" id="6321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Textbooks on relativity rarely mention that before Einstein’s theory came onto the scene, physicists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald had already proposed a solution</a> to the puzzle of why motion through the supposed “ether” couldn’t be detected. Their approach didn’t start with the idea that the speed of light was always constant. Instead, it rested on the belief that light traveled through a universal medium — an invisible substance that filled all of space and served as the carrier of electromagnetic waves: the “luminiferous ether.”</p><p name="600c" id="600c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might remember the classical atomic model from school: electrons orbiting a central nucleus, held in place by electromagnetic forces. Back then, these forces were thought to rely on the ether for transmission, much like how sound needs air to travel. Lorentz hypothesized that if atoms moved through this medium, their internal structure would distort slightly in the direction of motion. This subtle squeezing effect would cause all matter — being made of atoms — to contract. The math behind this shrinkage became known as the Lorentz contraction, which, interestingly, is identical to what Einstein later predicted using a completely different line of reasoning.</p><figure name="aa2d" id="aa2d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*cGmV21NcEkJ0sShSU3vx8w.png" data-width="464" data-height="184" src="/assets/1*cGmV21NcEkJ0sShSU3vx8w.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">How atoms distort slightly in the direction of motion</figcaption></figure><p name="5646" id="5646" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although Lorentz’s model was eventually abandoned, it wasn’t because it made incorrect predictions. Rather, it was superseded by Einstein’s formulation, which was more streamlined, required fewer assumptions, and applied more generally. Still, Lorentz’s contribution is not forgotten: the transformation equations used in special relativity still bear his name.</p><p name="99dc" id="99dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For most people, the concept of space remains rooted in Newton’s idea of an absolute, unchanging arena — something that exists independently of what’s in it. If two objects are one meter apart, they are assumed to be one meter apart for everyone, in all frames of reference. That feels like common sense. But modern physics tells us this view doesn’t reflect reality.</p><p name="c2b6" id="c2b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back when the definition of a meter was based on a platinum rod stored in Paris, distances were thought to be rigid and universal. But Lorentz raised an intriguing possibility: what if that meter stick itself shrinks as it moves? And what if every measuring tool contracts by the same proportion? In that case, we’d still measure the same distances, but what we perceive as “one meter” would actually be shorter. Rather than saying the meter stick shrank, it’s more accurate — and less confusing — to say that space itself contracted.</p><blockquote name="d3ad" id="d3ad" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">This leads us to a deeper realization: the <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">classical notion of absolute space is no longer physically meaningful</strong>. Physics deals with what can be measured. And <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">if every ruler in motion gets shorter, then so does the space itself is contracted.</strong></blockquote><p name="bb83" id="bb83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If light traveled much slower, and relativistic effects occurred at everyday speeds, we might not have developed the idea of space as something absolute. A car zipping past us might visibly flatten in its direction of motion, and we’d think of that as completely normal. In that alternate reality, the idea of absolute, immutable space might never have entered human thought at all.</p><p name="967a" id="967a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, it makes sense that Newton’s absolute space eventually gave way to something more practical: measurable, relative space. But when it comes to time, the confusion cuts even deeper. How is it possible that an astronaut traveling near the speed of light can age more slowly than a twin who stays on Earth?</p><p name="11b4" id="11b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here, too, we must distinguish between two concepts: absolute time, as imagined by Newton, and physical time — the kind we measure with clocks. And “clocks” don’t just mean ticking mechanisms. Any regular process — such as radioactive decay or human aging — serves as a timekeeper. Aging is a complex chemical process, and these processes, rooted in physical interactions, especially electromagnetic ones, can be affected by motion. If motion distorts those interactions, then the entire process, including aging, slows down.</p><blockquote name="8bb2" id="8bb2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">So again, while we could theoretically preserve the idea of <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">absolute time</strong>, it becomes <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">meaningless in practical terms</strong>. Everything we know about time comes from physical processes, and all of those are subject to the effects of motion. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">If absolute time can’t be observed or measured, then in the language of science, it doesn’t really exist.</strong></blockquote><p name="3c26" id="3c26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The concept of mass faces a similar rethinking. We’re used to thinking of mass as the “amount of stuff” in an object. But in physics, mass is more accurately defined by how much an object resists being pushed — its inertia. Push a heavy object and a light one with the same force, and the lighter one accelerates more. That’s how we recognize mass: by how hard it is to accelerate something.</p><p name="eed9" id="eed9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We exert force through physical interactions — specifically, four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of these, gravity in Einstein’s general theory is no longer a “force” in the traditional sense but a warping of space itself. The strong force is confined to atomic nuclei. The remaining two — electromagnetic and weak — are what we typically use to apply forces to objects. These were unified in the 1970s under the term “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">electroweak interaction</a>.”</p><p name="9901" id="9901" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, imagine you’re trying to push an object inside a fast-moving spaceship. If the interaction that transmits your push is slightly altered by the ship’s speed, the object will resist more than usual. To us, it feels like the object has gained mass. This is how we can explain increasing mass with motion — not as adding “more matter,” but as a change in how the object responds to forces.</p><blockquote name="30b4" id="30b4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">An outstanding Hungarian physicist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajos_J%C3%A1nossy" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajos_J%C3%A1nossy" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lajos Jánossy</a>, developed an extension of Lorentz’s theory that also applied to time and mass, but unfortunately, this too has fallen into obscurity. I only learned about the existence of this theory from his correspondence with Erwin Schrödinger.</blockquote><p name="a8ce" id="a8ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So Lorentz’s ether-based model wasn’t incorrect; it simply got replaced by a version that explained more with less. Einstein’s theory succeeded because it took a bold step: it removed the ether and treated the speed of light as the only true constant.</p><p name="95c8" id="95c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That raises a question: if relativity removed the ether, what happened to it? Was it simply discarded? In a way, yes — but not entirely. Like absolute space and time, the ether faded from physics because it couldn’t be detected. If something has no observable effect, then science sets it aside. But then, what carries a light wave through empty space?</p><p name="9f76" id="9f76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Einstein’s answer was simple: nothing needs to carry it. Light travels through space itself. Space is no longer just an empty void — it behaves like a medium. In a sense, Einstein redefined the ether instead of abolishing it. Space itself became the medium, capable of supporting electromagnetic waves and responding to the presence of mass and energy. Under general relativity, this flexible space is what curves to create gravity.</p><p name="ea48" id="ea48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, rather than vanishing, the ether transformed. It became space, not a passive, inert background, but an active, dynamic entity.</p><h4 name="2307" id="2307" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What Special Relativity Reveals About Reality</h4><p name="75a2" id="75a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At its core, the most important lesson of special relativity is disarmingly simple: Einstein used the terms <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">space</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">time</em> to refer to things very different from what most people intuitively think they mean.</p><p name="2506" id="2506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the average person, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">space</em> is still something like Newton’s version — a rigid, unchanging stage where objects move and events occur. But Einstein reimagined space as something much more like the old idea of the ether: a medium that pervades the universe. In this space, electromagnetic waves travel, and particles move — perhaps even existing as localized disturbances or standing waves in the medium itself. This space isn’t passive; it responds to mass and energy, warping in ways that produce the phenomenon we call gravity. Unlike electromagnetism, gravity in Einstein’s framework isn’t a force in the traditional sense — it’s a manifestation of curved space.</p><p name="81c3" id="81c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It might be tempting to think of Einstein’s space as something that “fills” Newton’s absolute space, but such a distinction is unobservable. All particles, all events, and all processes happen <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">within</em> Einstein’s space. Since nothing physical can occur outside it, this space becomes the only one that has scientific meaning — it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> space.</p><p name="409a" id="409a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same conceptual shift applies to time. What Einstein called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">time</em> isn’t the absolute, universal clock imagined by Newton. Instead, it refers to the duration of physical processes — what we actually measure with clocks. And “clocks” include not only wristwatches or digital timers, but any phenomenon that unfolds over time: radioactive decay, the ticking of mechanical gears, or the aging of living organisms.</p><p name="6a43" id="6a43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In theory, one might imagine that Einstein’s time flows within some deeper, absolute time, just as one might imagine his space inside a hidden absolute space. But if that background framework cannot be measured or observed, it holds no place in physics. What matters is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">measurable</em> time, the kind grounded in physical events. And since the rate at which these processes unfold depends on motion and gravity, time and space are inherently intertwined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spacetime</a>.</p><p name="5c82" id="5c82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This interconnection isn’t merely a theoretical abstraction. It shows up in real-world technology. Consider GPS satellites orbiting Earth: they carry ultra-precise atomic clocks that tick at a different rate than identical clocks on the surface. Why? Because both their velocity and the lower gravity at high altitude cause time to pass at a different rate. If engineers ignored these relativistic effects, GPS systems would produce location errors of kilometers within minutes.</p><p name="1894" id="1894" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, special relativity challenges the everyday models we carry around in our heads. What we call <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">space</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">time</em> are convenient approximations — intuitive frameworks shaped by human experience, not the universe’s deeper truths. When physicists refer to these terms, they’re often speaking about entities with behaviors and properties far removed from common understanding.</p><p name="0cbc" id="0cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In this sense, Einstein’s spacetime — a unified, dynamic entity — is less like empty geometry and more like the reimagined ether: a physical medium with structure, rules, and influence. Had scientists continued calling it “ether” (or chosen any new fancy name), perhaps more people would have grasped relativity sooner.</p></div></div></section><section name="187d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1f8c" id="1f8c" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">My other writings on scientific topics:</p><div name="f17a" id="f17a" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://thebojda.medium.com/understanding-the-bizarre-nature-of-quantum-mechanics-through-a-few-interpretations-1c9b535716ce" data-href="https://thebojda.medium.com/understanding-the-bizarre-nature-of-quantum-mechanics-through-a-few-interpretations-1c9b535716ce" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://thebojda.medium.com/understanding-the-bizarre-nature-of-quantum-mechanics-through-a-few-interpretations-1c9b535716ce"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Understanding the Bizarre Nature of Quantum Mechanics Through a Few Interpretations</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">There’s a famous saying by physicist Richard Feynman: if you want to understand the strangeness of quantum mechanics…</em>thebojda.medium.com</a><a href="https://thebojda.medium.com/understanding-the-bizarre-nature-of-quantum-mechanics-through-a-few-interpretations-1c9b535716ce" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="86da7f456d06583c8766602b18eecafa" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*qX-Dm4rSCt--J226" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*qX-Dm4rSCt--J226);"></a></div><div name="5ae3" id="5ae3" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Intergalactic Aliens: A Reality Check on Starships, Nanobots, and Cosmic Evolution</strong><br >medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/predict/intergalactic-aliens-a-reality-check-on-starships-nanobots-and-cosmic-evolution-5d9dbd2d21d0" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="80796386826f956cadcada4f904382ba" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*BUIiPSgxxCoCuG0g9NggHA.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*BUIiPSgxxCoCuG0g9NggHA.png);"></a></div><div name="fa67" id="fa67" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">How to Escape From the Simulation</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">In 2023, a research paper surfaced that tackled a fascinating and somewhat unsettling question: if our reality is…</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/predict/how-to-escape-from-the-simulation-e3fa697d821a" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="457e049f1cd0b11ae118a8bf75488fa2" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*FjAaMQ8kN7ZXBJcOm_7Jww.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*FjAaMQ8kN7ZXBJcOm_7Jww.png);"></a></div><div name="3109" id="3109" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Free Energy Principle and the Ultimate Simulation: Are Our Brains Already Wired Together?</strong><br ><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">One day, my son asked me why people are afraid of the dark.
