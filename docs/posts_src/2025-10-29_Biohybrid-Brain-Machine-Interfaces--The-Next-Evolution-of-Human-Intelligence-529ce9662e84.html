These systems read the brain’s electrical activity and, in turn, stimulate neurons — forming a two-way communication link between biology and machines.</p><p name="c5ea" id="c5ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In just a few decades, BMIs have evolved from laboratory curiosities into one of the fastest-growing frontiers in science and engineering. The possibilities are staggering. In the future, neural interfaces could restore vision to the blind, enable paralyzed individuals to move again, facilitate seamless communication between human brains and artificial intelligence, and ultimately power virtual realities that are indistinguishable from the physical world.</p><p name="f121" id="f121" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This convergence of biology, computing, and neuroscience marks the dawn of a new era — one where the boundaries between human and machine begin to blur.</p><p name="8f07" id="8f07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When most people hear the term brain–machine interface, the first name that comes to mind is Elon Musk’s <a href="https://neuralink.com/" data-href="https://neuralink.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuralink</a>. That’s not surprising — Musk’s marketing influence has brought the concept of neural implants into mainstream discussion.</p><p name="9c70" id="9c70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The roots of this field stretch back decades. One of the earliest and most influential devices was the Utah Array — a tiny, four-millimeter square grid holding a hundred microscopic electrodes, resembling a miniature bed of nails. Implanted directly into brain tissue, it can record the electrical signals produced by neurons and relay them to an external computer for interpretation.</p><figure name="8bb9" id="8bb9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XlhJUiH85Il5RBXB-RQfQA.png" data-width="451" data-height="322" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XlhJUiH85Il5RBXB-RQfQA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Utah array, source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/" data-href="https://www.researchgate.net/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="c829" id="c829" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Neuralink, by contrast, represents a dramatic leap forward — one might call it the Tesla of brain–machine interfaces. Instead of using rigid metal electrodes, Neuralink employs ultra-thin, flexible threads finer than a human hair. These threads are inserted with robotic precision into specific regions of the brain through a coin-sized opening in the skull. The robot’s involvement is crucial: no human surgeon could achieve such accuracy without causing significant damage to delicate neural tissue.</p><p name="fae9" id="fae9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once implanted, the processing unit sits neatly within the skull, hidden beneath the skin. The entire interface becomes invisible to the outside observer, creating a seamless blend between biology and technology. Neuralink is undoubtedly at the cutting edge of neuroengineering — but as remarkable as it is, it might only be the beginning of something even more revolutionary.</p><p name="3510" id="3510" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Neuralink dominates the headlines, another company is quietly exploring an equally transformative frontier in brain–machine interfaces. That company is <a href="https://science.xyz/" data-href="https://science.xyz/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Science</a>, founded by <a href="https://maxhodak.com/" data-href="https://maxhodak.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Max Hodak</a>, who previously co-founded and led Neuralink before leaving in 2021.</p><p name="a8db" id="a8db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Science is pursuing multiple lines of research, but two projects stand out as especially groundbreaking: the PRIMA visual prosthesis and the biohybrid brain–computer interface.</p><p name="d1da" id="d1da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The PRIMA system takes a radically different approach to restoring sight. Instead of connecting directly to the brain, it focuses on the eye itself. The implant is a tiny 2×2 mm chip placed in the retina, designed to bypass damaged photoreceptor cells and directly stimulate the bipolar cells responsible for transmitting visual information.</p><p name="4b6f" id="4b6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chip operates like a microscopic solar panel — a matrix of light-sensitive cells powered by a laser embedded in a special pair of glasses. The glasses capture real-world images through a camera, project them onto the implant using laser light, and the chip converts this information into electrical impulses that the retina can interpret.</p><p name="9bfe" id="9bfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of PRIMA’s elegant design features is that the same laser both transmits and powers the visual data, eliminating the need for any external power source. The system has already entered clinical trials, and the results are highly promising. With this technology, many blind individuals may soon regain partial vision — even the ability to read again.</p><p name="2a9b" id="2a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If commercialized, PRIMA could become Science’s first major product, providing the foundation to fund the company’s even more ambitious research: the development of a biohybrid interface that merges living neurons with silicon.</p><p name="b488" id="b488" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the remarkable progress made by Neuralink and other BMI pioneers, every existing brain interface still faces the same fundamental obstacle — the brain itself. The human brain is an incredibly dense, compact structure made up of roughly 86 billion neurons, each forming thousands of synaptic connections. It’s a living network so intricate that even the smallest intrusion can disrupt its delicate balance.</p><p name="52be" id="52be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This complexity makes integration extremely difficult. Conventional BMIs rely on metal electrodes or silicon probes to detect and transmit signals, but these rigid materials don’t blend naturally with soft, living tissue. Over time, the immune system reacts, scar tissue forms, and the quality of the neural connection deteriorates.</p><p name="b6b8" id="b6b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This limitation caps how far traditional interfaces can go. As a result, scientists and engineers have long searched for a way to build a system that doesn’t just connect to the brain but can become part of it.</p><p name="81ca" id="81ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s exactly where Science’s biohybrid interface comes in — a bold attempt to create a new class of neural implants that merge living neurons with semiconductor technology. Instead of forcing metal into biology, this approach lets biology and technology grow together.</p><p name="2b3b" id="2b3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biohybrid chip developed by Science takes the concept of a brain–computer interface to an entirely new level. Like Neuralink, it is designed to communicate directly with the brain — but its core innovation lies in how it connects. Instead of relying on metallic electrodes, this chip integrates living, genetically modified neurons into its structure.</p><p name="090f" id="090f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The base of the device is produced using conventional semiconductor fabrication, forming a grid of microscopic chambers. Each chamber contains a light-emitting micro-LED and a capacitive sensor — the building blocks that allow the chip to both stimulate and read neural activity.</p><figure name="ba54" id="ba54" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ogoB83HGW6Ess3rn.png" data-width="407" data-height="325" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ogoB83HGW6Ess3rn.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">source: science.xyz</figcaption></figure><p name="af46" id="af46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">During the next stage of production, engineered neurons are placed into these microscopic cells. Once implanted into the brain, these neurons begin to grow natural synaptic connections with the surrounding tissue, effectively weaving themselves into the brain’s existing circuitry.</p><p name="7395" id="7395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This approach replaces the mechanical precision of inserting thousands of electrodes with a far more elegant process — letting biology do the integration work. The living cells adapt, connect, and form communication pathways on their own, creating a bridge between silicon and biology that evolves organically over time.</p><p name="e919" id="e919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The modified neurons are light-sensitive, which is why the micro-LEDs are essential. They activate specific neurons with flashes of light, while the capacitive sensors detect their responses. This combination allows the system to read and transmit neural data with unprecedented bandwidth, potentially supporting complex, real-time communication between the human brain and external computers.</p><p name="546f" id="546f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In essence, this living chip is not just an interface — it’s an extension of the nervous system itself, merging biological intelligence with synthetic hardware in a way that previous generations of BMI technology could only imagine.</p><p name="2c9e" id="2c9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes this technology truly extraordinary is that it doesn’t merely connect to the brain — it adds to it. By integrating engineered neurons directly into brain tissue, the biohybrid interface effectively introduces a new, artificial layer of neural processing on top of our biological one.</p><p name="c375" id="c375" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The human brain itself is already built in layers. The most recent of these, evolutionarily speaking, is the neocortex — the seat of abstract reasoning, complex thought, and imagination. It’s what allowed humanity to rise beyond instinct and build civilization.</p><p name="6c36" id="6c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, through biohybrid technology, we may be on the verge of adding yet another layer — a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cyber cortex</strong>, composed not of naturally evolved neurons but of synthetic, engineered ones. This new layer could bridge biological and digital intelligence, allowing thoughts to flow seamlessly between human minds and artificial systems.</p><p name="713a" id="713a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such an extension could represent the next major leap in human neural evolution. The neocortex once enabled language, art, and technology; the cyber cortex could enable direct mind–machine integration and even shared cognition across individuals. It’s not just an upgrade — it’s the potential birth of a new kind of consciousness that unites organic and digital thought into one continuum.</p><p name="2a0a" id="2a0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The emergence of a cyber cortex could open possibilities far beyond today’s imagination. One of the most intriguing ideas, often mentioned by Max Hodak, is direct brain-to-brain communication — the ability for two or more human minds to share thoughts and experiences without speaking or typing a single word.</p><p name="dca1" id="dca1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Such technology could lead to the creation of shared virtual environments powered not by external computers but by the connected activity of human brains themselves. In theory, if our minds could synchronize efficiently, these collective mental spaces might require only minimal external hardware. I wrote about this idea in more detail in one of my previous articles.</p><div name="8bd5" id="8bd5" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" data-href="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/predict/the-free-energy-principle-and-the-ultimate-simulation-are-our-brains-already-wired-together-62be69a07d79"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Free Energy Principle and the Ultimate Simulation: Are Our Brains Already Wired Together?</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">One day, my son asked me why people are afraid of the dark.

This concept echoes the dream of a true Matrix-like existence, not as a dystopian fantasy but as the next step in immersive human experience.</p><p name="42fc" id="42fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If realized, such systems could redefine what it means to “live” or “exist” in digital space. Physical resources, screens, and devices might become obsolete. Instead of using technology as an external tool, we would inhabit it — merging our perceptions and memories into fully shared cognitive realities.</p><p name="ca41" id="ca41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In that sense, the cyber cortex wouldn’t just expand individual intelligence; it could enable a new form of collective intelligence, blurring the boundary between human consciousness and the virtual world.</p><p name="7fef" id="7fef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If human experience could one day unfold entirely within a shared, brain-linked virtual world, many of our current challenges might cease to exist in their present form. In such a reality, scarcity could disappear. Energy, materials, and physical resources would no longer limit what we can create or access. Everything we need could exist as information — infinitely reproducible and freely distributed.</p><p name="1c56" id="1c56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a virtual post-scarcity society, hunger, poverty, and inequality could become relics of the past. Digital environments could be designed to ensure that everyone has access to the same opportunities and comforts, independent of physical constraints. Conflicts over land or resources might lose all meaning when those resources can be replicated without cost.</p><p name="11fe" id="11fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This doesn’t mean abandoning the real world but redefining our relationship with it. Instead of exhausting Earth’s finite reserves, humanity could shift its innovation into virtual realms, where creativity replaces consumption.</p><p name="4c99" id="4c99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through biohybrid interfaces and the emergence of the cyber cortex, we could ultimately redesign reality itself — not by changing human nature, but by transforming the framework in which we exist.</p><p name="0d5c" id="0d5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a radical vision: a civilization that sustains itself not through physical expansion, but through digital evolution — one in which the limits of matter give way to the infinite potential of mind.</p><div name="3146" id="3146" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/why-brain-machine-interfaces-will-be-human-kinds-greatest-invention-d4de84197e6b" data-href="https://medium.com/geekculture/why-brain-machine-interfaces-will-be-human-kinds-greatest-invention-d4de84197e6b" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/geekculture/why-brain-machine-interfaces-will-be-human-kinds-greatest-invention-d4de84197e6b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Why Brain-Machine Interfaces Will Be Human Kind’s Greatest Invention</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">I admit that the title may seem strange at first.

Creating fully integrated neural networks and shared cognitive realities will take decades — perhaps generations. Yet every major leap in human progress began as an idea that seemed impossible at first.</p><p name="b85c" id="b85c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s clear is that brain–machine interfaces are more than just another high-tech gadget trend. They represent a turning point in how humanity relates to its own mind. The merging of biology and technology could open a path to transcend our current limitations — physical, cognitive, even existential.</p><p name="840a" id="840a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our civilization faces undeniable challenges: environmental collapse, inequality, and the risk of self-destruction through our own technologies. But the same tools that threaten us might also hold the key to our next stage of evolution.</p><p name="4381" id="4381" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If biohybrid interfaces fulfill their promise, they could redefine what it means to be human. We might one day design not only our tools and environments but the very structure of our consciousness. Through the synthesis of neurons and circuits, the human story could move beyond survival — toward the creation of entirely new realities.</p><p name="2645" id="2645" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The biohybrid future may not arrive tomorrow, but its foundations are already being built today. And when it does, it won’t just change how we interact with machines — it could change the meaning of being alive.</p></div></div></section>
