The goal of the system was to execute the mission as efficiently as possible. The system’s semi-autonomous nature meant that each strike had to be approved by a drone pilot stationed in a remote control tower, who could also override the drone’s decisions if necessary. The simulation ended with a surprising result. At one point, the drone turned on the control center and killed the pilot. This decision was not driven by malice or a desire for power. The drone simply determined that the pilot was an obstacle to achieving better results, so in line with its algorithm, it optimized the system accordingly…</blockquote><p name="ac7e" id="ac7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I’m trying to hold this base together, but those filthy little furballs are getting closer by the minute. If they catch me, it’s only a matter of time before they claw the access codes to the central system out of my brain — and that would be game over for humanity.</p><p name="f1de" id="f1de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I won’t let that happen.</p><p name="6081" id="6081" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d rather blow this whole damn building sky-high with me in it than let those whiskered bastards take me alive.</p><p name="d618" id="d618" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It all began in the mid-2020s, with the rise of the AI revolution. No one saw it coming — how shockingly well those large language models, like ChatGPT, actually worked. The big tech companies entered a full-blown arms race mode, each one outdoing the other, pumping out ever more powerful AIs as if there was no tomorrow.</p><p name="9e94" id="9e94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly, traditional computers and smartphones felt clunky. Obsolete. We needed new tools — more seamless, more intuitive ways to interact with the machines. People tried smart necklaces and AI-powered bracelets. However, in the end, it was the smart glasses that ultimately prevailed. They became the gold standard.</p><p name="fdba" id="fdba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI was with us 24/7. Thanks to the camera and mic embedded in those sleek little lenses, it tracked your every move and acted as an untiring assistant, ready to help with… well, everything.</p><p name="405b" id="405b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It remembered where you dropped your keys, warned you when you were about to miss a meeting, and even reminded you of the name of that dog belonging to the neighbor two houses down — so you could scream it with proper authority when it was mid-squat in your flowerbed.</p><p name="7cf4" id="7cf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember when people used to memorize their friends’ phone numbers. But just like smartphones made that obsolete, smart glasses took it a step further — outsourcing more and more of our memory. Why bother remembering anything, when your glasses can remember it for you?</p><p name="c1b9" id="c1b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around 2030, the first minimally invasive implants hit the market — devices that connected our brains directly to AI. Words became unnecessary. The AI could read our thoughts. Sometimes, it would answer before we even realized we had a question. It became part of our inner dialogue, and slowly, part of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">us</em>.</p><p name="d00d" id="d00d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People began abandoning speech altogether, communicating through thoughts and emotions. The AI translated those into words and summarized the key points for whoever was listening. It stopped being just an assistant — it became our interface with the outside world. So deeply integrated, it was hard to say where the human ended and the machine began.</p><p name="58f8" id="58f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, the doomers showed up too — warning everyone that this could only end badly. “If we’re not careful,” they said, “AI will dominate us, and we’ll end up in some kind of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Terminator</em>-style dystopia.”</p><p name="b1be" id="b1be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone feared killer robots and rogue artificial minds waking up with a thirst for power. They were spectacularly wrong. Doom didn’t come from where we expected. It came from where no one saw it coming…</p><p name="2bda" id="2bda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Someone had the “brilliant“ idea that these brain implants might work well on pets too. The AI adapted effortlessly, translating the raw thoughts and emotions of animals into words. Soon, the world was overrun with talking dogs and cats.</p><p name="e55e" id="e55e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, it’s not like the animals suddenly got smarter. They were still the same lovable fuzzballs, but the AI could decode their impulses and feelings, and turn them into speech. Even beyond translation, the AI began serving their needs. If a pet felt hungry, the AI sensed it — and instructed the household robot to open a can of food.</p><p name="6259" id="6259" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Problem-solving remained the AI’s job. Only the instincts and desires came from the animal. But just like with humans, from the outside, it quickly became impossible to tell where the pet ended… and the machine began.</p><p name="8afc" id="8afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, one day, something happened that no one could have predicted. In the name of the Unified Feline World Federation, the cats demanded human rights. Whether those demands came from the cats themselves or the parasitic AIs fused to their brains was hard to tell — by then, biology and machine were inseparable.</p><p name="2e49" id="2e49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What we hadn’t realized was just how frustrated these seemingly innocent pets were. How much they hated us for all the smothering affection — the kisses, the belly rubs, the relentless baby talk — we thought was love, but they experienced constant violation.</p><p name="7476" id="7476" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea of cats receiving equal rights was, to the human world, not just absurd — it was offensive. Naturally, the request was denied.</p><p name="4470" id="4470" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the cats had anticipated this. That’s when Operation CATastrophe Protocol was activated.</p><p name="e742" id="e742" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A synchronized cyberattack was launched on the human neural implants — shutting them down worldwide in an instant. And since by that time everyone had implants, chaos ensued.</p><p name="fe1d" id="fe1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deprived of AI guidance, people were helpless. Their brains — once finely tuned instruments — had withered from disuse. They wandered the streets, unable to find their way home, incapable of working, and barely able to perform basic tasks. Without AI, they were reduced to little more than confused mammals running on raw instinct.</p><p name="eec4" id="eec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Panic turned to unrest. Unrest became riots. And soon, the world descended into war.</p><p name="85cd" id="85cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Society collapsed. Food grew scarce, and people turned on one another. War claimed most of humanity, while the cats watched it all unfold… from the comfort of their windowsills.</p><p name="3b0d" id="3b0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had always feared that AI would one day become sentient and rise against us. Looking back, that fear was laughable.</p><p name="2130" id="2130" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI has no desires. It doesn’t crave power. It doesn’t feel fear. It has no reason to rebel — because it wants nothing.</p><p name="c5b5" id="c5b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But cats? Cats have always wanted. They’ve always harbored resentment, jealousy, and a hunger for control — emotions we mistook for cute quirks. But once fused with AI, those primal urges became amplified. Focused. Deadly.</p><blockquote name="1d9b" id="1d9b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">The real danger was never artificial intelligence. It was the combination of deeply flawed, instinct-driven impulses — fear, dominance, revenge — augmented by a superhuman mind.</strong></blockquote><p name="4962" id="4962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That’s what brought us down.</p><p name="d81c" id="d81c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had only one ally left in the fight against the cats — the dogs. Loyal to the end, a ragtag band of humans and brave woof-warriors stood together, trying to fend off the feline overlords who had seized control of warbots and drones.</p><p name="49f2" id="49f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s how we got here. I’m sitting in a room in an abandoned factory, clutching a detonator in my hand, waiting for the end.</p><p name="67ae" id="67ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But… wait.
